<p>In this phase, you will write two libraries, one command-line
utility, and review one library. You will be working in the
<code>stack-vec</code>, <code>volatile</code>, <code>ttywrite</code>, and <code>xmodem</code> skeleton
subdirectories located in <code>lib</code> directory.</p>
<p>All projects are being managed with Cargo. You will find the
following <code>cargo</code> commands useful:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cargo build</code> - build an application or library</li>
<li><code>cargo test</code> - test an application or library</li>
<li><code>cargo run</code> - run an application</li>
<li><code>cargo run -- $flags</code> - run an application and pass arbitrary flags to it</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="subphase-a-stackvec">Subphase A: <code>StackVec</code></h3>
<p>One important facility that operating systems provide is memory
allocation. When a C, Rust, Java, Python, or just about <em>any</em>
application calls <code>malloc()</code> and <code>malloc()</code> has run out of
memory from the operating system, a system call is eventually made
to request additional memory. The operating system determines if
there is memory available, and if so, fulfills the request for
memory.</p>


<div class="box box-shortcode info" >
    <span class="icon-box baseline">
      <svg><use href="#info-box"></use></svg>
    </span>
    <p>Memory allocation is a complicated story.</p>
<p>In practice, modern operating systems like Linux have a
complicated relationship with memory allocation. For instance,
as an optimization, most requests for memory allocation are
only &ldquo;virtually&rdquo; handled: no physical memory is actually
allocated until the application tries to use the newly
allocated memory. Nonetheless, most operating systems aim to
provide the <em>illusion</em> that they are allocating memory in the
simplistic manner we&rsquo;ve described. Operating systems are master
liars.</p>
  </div>

<p>Heap-allocated structures like <code>Vec</code>, <code>String</code>, and <code>Box</code>
internally call <code>malloc()</code> to allocate memory as necessary. This
means that these structures require operating system support to
function. In particular, they require the operating system to
support memory allocation. We haven&rsquo;t yet started writing our
operating system, so clearly there&rsquo;s no memory allocation support
for our tiny bare-metal programs to make use of. As such, we can&rsquo;t
use heap-allocated structures like <code>Vec</code> until our operating
system is further along.</p>
<p>This is a real shame because <code>Vec</code> is a nice abstraction! It
allows us to think about <code>push</code>ing and <code>pop</code>ing elements
without having to keep track of memory ourselves. <em>How we can get
the benefits of the</em> <code>Vec</code> <em>abstraction without supporting memory
allocation?</em></p>
<p>One common technique is to <em>pre-allocate</em> memory and then hand
that memory to a structure to abstract away. Some ways to
pre-allocate memory include using <code>static</code> declarations to set
apart memory in the static section of a binary or through stack
allocations from local variable declarations. In any case, the
allocations is of a fixed, predetermined size.</p>
<p>In this subphase, you will implement the <code>StackVec</code> structure, a
structure that exposes a <code>Vec</code>-like API when given pre-allocated
memory. You will use the <code>StackVec</code> type later in phase 2 when
implementing a shell for your Raspberry Pi. You will work in the
<code>lib/stack-vec</code> skeleton subdirectory. The subdirectory contains the
following files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Cargo.toml</code> - configuration file for Cargo</li>
<li><code>src/lib.rs</code> - where you will write your code</li>
<li><code>src/tests.rs</code> - tests that will run when <code>cargo test</code> is
called</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-stackvec-interface">The <code>StackVec</code> Interface</h4>
<p>A <code>StackVec&lt;T&gt;</code> is created by calling <code>StackVec::new()</code>,
passing in a mutable slice to values of any type <code>T</code>. The
<code>StackVec&lt;T&gt;</code> type implements many of the methods that
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/vec/struct.Vec.html"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Vec</a>

    <p>Why does <code>push</code> return a <code>Result</code>? (push-fails)</p>
<p>The <code>push</code> method from <code>Vec</code> in the standard library has
no return value, but the <code>push</code> method from our
<code>StackVec</code> does: it returns a <code>Result</code> indicating that
it can fail. Why can <code>StackVec::push()</code> fail where
<code>Vec::push()</code> does not?</p>

<h3 id="subphase-b-volatile">Subphase B: <code>volatile</code></h3>
<p>In this subphase, you will learn about volatile memory accesses,
read the source code in the <code>volatile</code> skeleton subdirectory,
and answer questions related to the source code. You won&rsquo;t be
writing any code in this subphase.</p>
<p>Like operating systems, compilers are masters at making things
<em>appear</em> as if they&rsquo;re doing what you think they&rsquo;re doing when in
reality, they&rsquo;re really doing something entirely different for the
sake of optimization. One such optimization is dead-access
elimination: compilers remove memory accesses (reads and writes)
when they can prove doing so has no observable effect on the
program&rsquo;s execution. For instance, consider the following program:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#cad3f5;background-color:#24273a;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-C" data-lang="C"><span style="display:flex;"><span>fn <span style="color:#8aadf4">f</span>() {
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    let mut x <span style="color:#91d7e3;font-weight:bold">=</span> <span style="color:#f5a97f">0</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    let y <span style="color:#91d7e3;font-weight:bold">=</span> <span style="color:#91d7e3;font-weight:bold">&amp;</span>mut x;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>    <span style="color:#91d7e3;font-weight:bold">*</span>y <span style="color:#91d7e3;font-weight:bold">=</span> <span style="color:#f5a97f">10</span>;
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The compiler can completely eliminate the write to <code>*y</code> by
reasoning that <code>*y</code> is never read after it&rsquo;s written. The
compiler concludes that as a result, the write cannot possibly
effect the program, and eliminates it in the compiled binary. For
the same reason, it can then proceed to eliminate the declaration
for <code>y</code>, the declaration for <code>x</code>, and calls to <code>f()</code>
entirely.</p>
<p>These kinds of optimizations are almost exclusively beneficial:
they speed up our programs without affecting their outcome. But
sometimes these optimizations can have unintended consequences.
Say, for example, that <code>y</code> was pointing to a write-only
memory-mapped register. Then, writes to <code>*y</code> <em>will</em> have
observable effects <em>without</em> having to read <code>*y</code> thereafter. If
the compiler is not aware of this, it will optimize away these
writes, and our program will not function correctly.</p>
<p>How can we force the compiler to keep around reads and writes that
appear to have no effects at the source code level? This is where
<code>volatile</code> memory accesses come in: the compiler promises <em>not</em>
to optimize away volatile memory accesses. So if we want to ensure
a read or write occurs at runtime, we must perform a volatile
memory access.</p>

    <p>What&rsquo;s a <em>raw</em> pointer?</p>
<p>By now you&rsquo;re familiar with references (<code>&amp;T</code> and <code>&amp;mut T</code>).
A raw pointer in Rust (<code>*const T</code> and <code>*mut T</code>) is a
&ldquo;reference&rdquo; that isn&rsquo;t tracked with lifetimes by Rust&rsquo;s borrow
checker. Because of this, read or writes to these pointers may
be invalid, just as in C. Rust considers them <code>unsafe</code>, and
code that reads or writes them must be annotated with
<code>unsafe</code> to indicate this. You can read more about <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/primitive.pointer.html"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">raw
pointers in the

every time we want to perform a volatile read or write is error
prone and frustrating. Thankfully Rust provides us the tools to
make this easier and safer. Ideally we can simply declare a
pointer as volatile (as in C) and ensure that every read or write
thereafter is volatile. Even better, we should be able declare a
pointer as read-only, write-only (unlike in C), or read/write and
ensure only the appropriate memory accesses can be made.</p>
<h4 id="introducing-volatile-readvolatile-writevolatile-and-uniquevolatile">Introducing <code>Volatile</code>, <code>ReadVolatile</code>, <code>WriteVolatile</code>, and <code>UniqueVolatile</code></h4>

    <p>What&rsquo;s with <code>#[repr(C)]</code>?</p>
<p>The <code>#[repr(C)]</code> annotation forces Rust to lay out the
structure&rsquo;s fields in the same way that C would. In general,
Rust optimizes the order and padding between fields of
structures in an unspecified way. When we cast a raw address to
a pointer to a structure, we typically have a very specific
memory layout in mind. The <code>#[repr(C)]</code> annotation lets us
confide that Rust will arrange the structure as we intend it
to, not as it wishes.</p>

<h3 id="subphase-c-xmodem">Subphase C: <code>xmodem</code></h3>
<p>In this subphase, you will implement the XMODEM file transfer
protocol in the <code>xmodem</code> library in the <code>xmodem/</code> skeleton
subdirectory. You will primarily be working in
<code>xmodem/src/lib.rs</code>.</p>
<p>XMODEM is a simple file transfer protocol originally developed in
1977. It features packet checksums, cancellation, and automatic
retries. It is widely implemented and used for transfers through
serial interfaces. Its best feature, however, is its simplicity.
For more about its history, see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMODEM"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">XMODEM Wikipedia
article</a>
.</p>
<p>We will use the XMODEM protocol to transfer files to the Raspberry
Pi. While we could use existing implementations of the XMODEM
protocol to <em>send</em> data to the Pi, we will still need to write our
own receiver. So, while we&rsquo;re at it, we&rsquo;ll be implementing XMODEM
transmission as well.</p>
<h4 id="the-protocol">The Protocol</h4>
<p>The XMODEM protocol is described in detail in the <a href="https://cs140e.sergio.bz/assignments/1-shell/data/XMODEM.txt"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Understanding

    <p>Do not base your implementation off of Wikipedia&rsquo;s explanation!</p>
<p>While Wikipedia&rsquo;s explanation is helpful at a high level, many
of the details presented there are different from the protocol
we&rsquo;ll be implementing here. As such, do not use the article as
a reference for this subphase.</p>
  </div>

<p>XMODEM is a binary protocol: bytes are sent and received in the
raw. It is also &ldquo;half duplex&rdquo;: at any point in time, either the
sender or receiver is sending data, but never both. Finally it is
packet-based: data is separated into 128 byte chunks known as
packets. The protocol dictates which bytes are sent when, what
they mean, and how they&rsquo;re interpreted.</p>
<p>First, we define a few constants:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#cad3f5;background-color:#24273a;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#c6a0f6">const</span> <span style="color:#eed49f">SOH</span>: <span style="color:#ed8796">u8</span> <span style="color:#91d7e3;font-weight:bold">=</span> <span style="color:#f5a97f">0x01</span>;

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>To start the file transfer, the receiver sends a <code>NAK</code> byte
while the sender waits for a <code>NAK</code> byte. Once the sender has
received the <code>NAK</code> byte, packet transmission begins. The
receiver only sends a <code>NAK</code> byte to begin the file transfer, not
once for every packet.</p>
<p>Once file transfer has begun, each packet&rsquo;s transmission and
reception is identical. Packets are numbered in sequential order
starting at <code>1</code> and wrap around to <code>0</code> after <code>255</code>.</p>

<p>To send a packet, the sender:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sends an <code>SOH</code> byte.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sends the packet number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sends the 1s complement of the packet number (<code>255 - $packet_number</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sends the packet itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sends the packet checksum.</p>
<ul>
<li>The checksum is the sum of all of the bytes in the packet mod 256.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reads a byte from the receiver.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the byte is <code>NAK</code>, transmission for the same packet is
retried up to 10 times.</li>
<li>If the byte is <code>ACK</code>, the next packet is sent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The receive a packet, the receiver performs the inverse:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Waits for an <code>SOH</code> or <code>EOT</code> byte from the sender.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a different byte is received, the receiver cancels the transfer.</li>
<li>If an <code>EOT</code> byte is received, the receiver performs end of transmission.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reads the next byte and compares it to the current packet number.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the wrong packet number is received, the receiver cancels the transfer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reads the next byte and compares it to the 1s complement of the packet number.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the wrong number is received, the receiver cancels the transfer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reads a packet (128 bytes) from the sender.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Computes the checksum for the packet.</p>
<ul>
<li>The checksum is the sum of all of the bytes in the packet mod 256.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reads the next byte and compares it to the computed checksum.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the checksum differs, sends a <code>NAK</code> byte and retries reception
for the same packet.</li>
<li>If the checksum is the same, sends an <code>ACK</code> byte and receives
the next packet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To cancel a transfer, a <code>CAN</code> byte is sent by either the
receiver or sender. When either side receives a <code>CAN</code> byte, it
errors out, aborting the connection.</p>
<p>To end the transmission, the sender:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sends an <code>EOT</code> byte.</li>
<li>Waits for a <code>NAK</code> byte. If a different byte is received, the
sender errors out.</li>
<li>Sends a second <code>EOT</code> byte.</li>
<li>Waits for an <code>ACK</code> byte. If a different byte is received, the
sender errors out.</li>
</ol>
<p>To end the transmission, the receiver performs the following after
receiving the first <code>EOT</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sends a <code>NAK</code> byte.</li>
<li>Waits for a second <code>EOT</code> byte. If a different byte is
received, the receiver cancels the transfer.</li>
<li>Sends an <code>ACK</code> byte.</li>

<h4 id="implementing-xmodem">Implementing XMODEM</h4>
<p>We have provided an unfinished implementation of the XMODEM
protocol in the <code>xmodem</code> skeleton subdirectory. Your task is to
complete the implementation by writing the <code>expect_byte</code>,
<code>expect_byte_or_cancel</code>, <code>read_packet</code>, and <code>write_packet</code>
methods in <code>src/lib.rs</code>. Your implementations should make use of
the internal state of the <code>Xmodem</code> type: <code>packet</code> and
<code>started</code>. We recommend reading over the existing code before
starting.</p>
<p>You should begin by implementing the <code>expect_byte</code> and
<code>expect_byte_or_cancel</code> methods. You should then make use of all
four of the helper methods (including <code>read_byte</code> and
<code>write_byte</code>) to implement <code>read_packet</code> and <code>write_packet</code>.
To see how these methods are used, read the <code>transmit</code> and
<code>receive</code> implementations which transmit or receive a complete
data stream using XMODEM via these methods. Be mindful of the
specifications in the doc-comments. You can test your
implementation using <code>cargo test</code>. Once you are confident that
your implementation is correct, proceed to the next subphase.</p>

which allows you to read and write to the serial device (via its
<code>io::Read</code> and <code>io::Write</code> trait implementations) as well as
read and set settings on a serial device (via its <code>SerialDevice</code>
trait implementation).</p>
<h4 id="writing-the-code">Writing the Code</h4>
<p>Implement the <code>ttywrite</code> utility. Your implementation should set
all of the appropriate settings passed in via the command-line
stored in the <code>opt</code> variable in <code>main</code>. It should read from
<code>stdin</code> if no input file is passed in or from the input file if
one is passed in. It should write the input data to the passed in
serial device. If the <code>-r</code> flag is set, it should send the data
as it is. Otherwise, you should use your <code>xmodem</code> implementation
from the previous subphase to send the data using the XMODEM
protocol. You should print the number of bytes sent on a
successful transmission.</p>
<p>To transmit using the XMODEM protocol, your code should use either
the <code>Xmodem::transmit</code> or <code>Xmodem::transmit_with_progress</code>
methods from the <code>xmodem</code> library. We recommend using
<code>transmit_with_progress</code> so that your utility indicates progress
throughput the transmission. In its simplest form, this might look
as follows:</p>

implementation is at least somewhat correct, you will see the
following when the script is run:</p>

    <p>Why does the <code>test.sh</code> script always set <code>-r</code>? (bad-tests)</p>
<p>The <code>test.sh</code> script that we have provided always uses the
<code>-r</code> flag; it doesn&rsquo;t test that your utility uses the
XMODEM protocol when it is asked to. Why might that be? What
does the XMODEM protocol expect that sending data in the raw
doesn&rsquo;t that makes testing its functionality difficult?</p>

You will need to manually modify the relevent files to resolve the conflict. Ensure that you keep all of your changes from lab 3.\nOnce all conflicts are resolved, add the resolved files with git add and commit.\nFor more information on resolving merge conflicts, see this tutorial on githowto.com .\nPhase 2: Not a Seashell Due to Raspberry Pi devices being unavailable at the moment, we have to skip the implementation parts of Subphase B and C.\nThe template code already has the implementation ready. Please read through them to understand the code though.\nIn this phase, you will be implementing drivers for the built-in timer, GPIO, and UART devices. You\u0026rsquo;ll use then these drivers to implement a simple shell. In the next phase, you\u0026rsquo;ll use the same drivers to implement a bootloader.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s a driver?\nThe term driver, or device driver, describes software that directly interacts with and controls a hardware device. Drivers expose a higher-level interface to the hardware they control. Operating systems may interact with device drivers to expose an even higher-level interface. For instance, the Linux kernel exposes ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture), an audio API, which interacts with device drivers that in-turn interact directly with sound cards.\nSubphase A: Getting Started Project Structure Let\u0026rsquo;s recall the repository structure we saw previously.\n. ├── ... ├── boot : bootloader * ├── kern : the main os kernel * └── lib : required libraries ├── pi * ├── shim ├── stack-vec * ├── ttywrite * ├── volatile * └── xmodem * All the libraries used by boot and kernel are located under the lib directory.\nshim library selectively depends on either std or no_std library. With #[cfg(feature = \u0026quot;no_std\u0026quot;)] specified, shim makes use of core_io and the custom no_std module which has minimum library we need such as ffi, path and sync. Otherwise, mostly in the test code, shim just uses std library.\npi subdirectory contains all of your driver code. The pi library makes use of the volatile library. It also depends on the shim library.\nboot and kernel make use of the pi library to communicate with hardware. They also depend on shim. In addition to that, boot also depends on the xmodem library, and kernel depends on the stack-vec library. The volatile library has no dependencies. The diagram below illustrates these relationships:\nKernel The kern directory contains the code for the operating system kernel: the core of your operating system. Calling make inside this directory builds the kernel. The build output is stored in the build/ directory. To run the kernel, use make qemu command. Please refer the Tools page to find details about our Makefile.\nAt present, the kernel does absolutely nothing. By the end of this phase, the kernel will start up a shell which you can communicate with.\nAs we saw above, the kernel crate depends on the pi library. As a result, you can use all of the types and items from the pi library in the kernel.\nDocumentation While writing your device drivers, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to keep the BCM2837 ARM Peripherals Manual open.\nSubphase B: System Timer Due to Raspberry Pi devices being unavailable at the moment, we have to skip the implementation parts of this Subphase.\nThe template code already has the implementation ready. Please read through the following parts and understand the code though.\nIn this subphase, you will write a device driver for the ARM system timer. You will primarily be working in lib/pi/src/timer.rs and kern/src/main.rs. The ARM system timer is documented on page 172 (section 12) of the BCM2837 ARM Peripherals Manual .\nStart by looking at the existing code in lib/pi/src/timer.rs. In particular, note the relationship between the following sections:\nconst TIMER_REG_BASE: usize = IO_BASE + 0x3000; #[repr(C)] struct Registers { CS: Volatile\u0026lt;u32\u0026gt;, CLO: ReadVolatile\u0026lt;u32\u0026gt;, CHI: ReadVolatile\u0026lt;u32\u0026gt;, COMPARE: [Volatile\u0026lt;u32\u0026gt;; 4] } pub struct Timer { registers: \u0026amp;\u0026#39;static mut Registers } impl Timer { pub fn new() -\u0026gt; Timer { Timer { registers: unsafe { \u0026amp;mut *(TIMER_REG_BASE as *mut Registers) }, } } } The one line of unsafe in this program is very important: it casts the TIMER_REG_BASE address to a *mut Registers and then casts that to an \u0026amp;'static mut Registers. We are telling Rust that we have a static reference to a Registers structure at address TIMER_REG_BASE.\nWhat is at the TIMER_REG_BASE address? On page 172 of the BCM2837 ARM Peripherals Manual , you\u0026rsquo;ll find that 0x3000 is the peripheral offset for the ARM system timer. Thus, TIMER_REG_BASE is the address at which the ARM system timer registers start! After this one line of unsafe, we can use the registers field to access the timer\u0026rsquo;s registers safely. We can read the CLO register with self.registers.CLO.read() and write the CS register with self.registers.CS.write(), then combine them together to represent the number of elapsed microseconds.\nWhy can\u0026rsquo;t you write to CLO or CHI? (restricted-reads)\nThe BCM2837 documentation states that the CLO and CHI registers are read-only. Our code enforces this property. How? What prevents us from writing to CLO or CHI?\nWhat exactly is unsafe?\nIn short, unsafe is a marker for the Rust compiler that you\u0026rsquo;re taking control of memory safety: the compiler won\u0026rsquo;t protect you from memory issues. As a result, in unsafe sections, Rust lets you do anything you can do in C. In particular, you can cast between types with more freedom, dereference raw pointers, and fabricate lifetimes.\nBut note that unsafe is very unsafe. You must ensure that everything you do in an unsafe section is, in fact safe. This is more difficult than it sounds, especially when Rust\u0026rsquo;s idea of safe is much stricter than in other languages. As such, you should try not to use unsafe at all. For operating systems, unfortunately, we must use unsafe so that we can directly speak to hardware, but we\u0026rsquo;ll typically limit our use to one line per driver.\nIf you want to learn more about unsafe, read Chapter 1 of the Nomicon .\nImplement the Driver Implement the Timer::read(), current_time(), and spin_sleep() in lib/pi/src/timer.rs. The signatures on these items indicate their expected functionality. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to read the timer\u0026rsquo;s documentation in the BCM manual to implement Timer::read(). In particular, you should understand which registers to read to obtain the timer\u0026rsquo;s current u64 value. You can build the pi library with cargo build. You can also use cargo check to type-check the library without actually compiling it.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll find the core::time::Duration page useful.\nTesting Your Driver Let\u0026rsquo;s test your driver by ensuring that spin_sleep() is accurate. We\u0026rsquo;ll write the code to do this in kern/src/main.rs.\nCopy your LED blinky code from phase 4 of lab 1 into main.rs. Instead of the for loop based sleep function, use your newly written spin_sleep() function with Duration to pause between blinks. Compile the kernel, load it onto the MicroSD card as kernel8.img, and then run it on the Raspberry Pi. Ensure that the LED blinks at the frequency that you intended it to. Try other pause times and ensure that they all work as expected. Until you write the bootloader in phase 3, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to keep swapping the MicroSD card between the Pi and your computer to try out different binaries.\nIf your timer driver is working as expected, proceed to the next subphase.\nSubphase C: GPIO Due to Raspberry Pi devices being unavailable at the moment, we have to skip the implementation parts of this Subphase.\nThe template code already has the implementation ready. Please read through the following parts and understand the code though.\nIn this subphase, you will write a generic, pin-independent device driver for GPIO. You will primarily be working in lib/pi/src/gpio.rs and kern/src/main.rs. The GPIO subsystem is documented on page 89 (section 6) of the BCM2837 ARM Peripherals Manual .\nState Machines All hardware devices are state machines : they begin at a predetermined state and transition to different states based on explicit or implicit inputs. The device exposes different functionality depending on which state it is in. In other words, only some transitions are valid in some states. Importantly, this implies that some transitions are invalid when the device is in a given state.\nMost programming languages make it impossible to faithfully encode the semantics of a state machine in hardware, but not Rust! Rust lets us perfectly encode state machine semantics, and we\u0026rsquo;ll take advantage of this to implement a safer-than-safe device driver for the GPIO subsystem. Our driver will ensure that a GPIO pin is never misused, and it will do so at compile-time.\nBelow is the state diagram for a subset of the GPIO state machine for a single pin:\nGPIO State Diagram Our goal is to encode this state machine in Rust. Let\u0026rsquo;s start by interpreting the diagram:\nThe GPIO starts in the START state.\nFrom the START state it can transition to one of three states:\nALT - no transitions are possible from this state OUTPUT - two \u0026ldquo;self\u0026rdquo; transitions are possible: SET and CLEAR INPUT - one \u0026ldquo;self\u0026rdquo; transition is possible: LEVEL Which transitions did you follow in your lab 1 blinky? (blinky-states)\nWhen you implementing the blinky code in phase 4 of lab 1, you implicitly implemented a subset of this state machine. Which transitions did your code implement?\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll use Rust\u0026rsquo;s type system to ensure that a pin can only be SET and CLEARed if it has been transitioned to the OUTPUT state and the LEVEL read if it is in the INPUT state. Take a look at the declaration for the GPIO structure in lib/pi/src/gpio.rs:\npub struct Gpio\u0026lt;State\u0026gt; { pin: u8, registers: \u0026amp;\u0026#39;static mut Registers, _state: PhantomData\u0026lt;State\u0026gt; } The structure has one generic argument, State. Except for PhantomData, nothing actually uses this argument. This is what PhantomData is there for: to convince Rust that the structure somehow uses the generic even though it otherwise wouldn\u0026rsquo;t. We\u0026rsquo;re going to use the State generic to encode which state the Gpio device is in. Unlike other generics, we must control this parameter and ensure that a client can never fabricate it.\nThe state! macro generates types that represent the states a Gpio can be in:\nstates! { Uninitialized, Input, Output, Alt } // Each parameter expands to an `enum` that looks like: enum Input { } This is also weird; why would we create an enum with no variants? enum\u0026rsquo;s with no variants have a nice property: they can never be instantiated. In this way, these types act purely as markers. No one can ever pass us a value of type Input because such a value can never be constructed. They exist purely at the type-level.\nWe can then implement methods corresponding to valid transitions given that a Gpio is in a certain state:\nimpl Gpio\u0026lt;Output\u0026gt; { /// Sets (turns on) the pin. pub fn set(\u0026amp;mut self) { ... } /// Clears (turns off) the pin. pub fn clear(\u0026amp;mut self) { ... } } impl Gpio\u0026lt;Input\u0026gt; { /// Reads the pin\u0026#39;s value. pub fn level(\u0026amp;mut self) -\u0026gt; bool { ... } } This ensures that a Gpio can only be set and cleared when it is a Gpio\u0026lt;Output\u0026gt; and its level read when it is a Gpio\u0026lt;Input\u0026gt;. Perfect! But how do we actually transition between states? Hello, Gpio::transition()!\nimpl\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; Gpio\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; { fn transition\u0026lt;S\u0026gt;(self) -\u0026gt; Gpio\u0026lt;S\u0026gt; { Gpio { pin: self.pin, registers: self.registers, _state: PhantomData } } } This method lets us transition a Gpio from any state to any other state. Given a Gpio in state T, this method returns a Gpio in state S. Note that it works for all S and T. We must be very careful when calling this method. When called, we are encoding the specification of a transition in the state diagram. If we get the specification or encoding wrong, our driver is wrong.\nTo use the transition() method, we need to tell Rust which type we want as an output S in Gpio\u0026lt;S\u0026gt;. We do this by giving Rust enough information so that it can infer the S type. For instance, consider the implementation of the into_output method:\npub fn into_output(self) -\u0026gt; Gpio\u0026lt;Output\u0026gt; { self.into_alt(Function::Output).transition() } This method requires its return type to be Gpio\u0026lt;Output\u0026gt;. When the Rust type system inspects the call to transition(), it will search for a Gpio::transition() method that returns a Gpio\u0026lt;Output\u0026gt; to satisfy the requirement. Since our transition method returns Gpio\u0026lt;S\u0026gt; for any S, Rust will replace S with Output and use that method. The result is that we\u0026rsquo;ve transformed our Gpio\u0026lt;Alt\u0026gt; (from the into_alt() call) into a Gpio\u0026lt;Output\u0026gt;.\nWhat would go wrong if a client fabricates states? (fake-states)\nConsider what would happen if we let the user choose the initial state for a Gpio structure. What could go wrong?\nWhy is this only possible with Rust?\nNotice that the into_ transition methods take a Gpio by move. This means that once a Gpio is transitioned into a another state, it can never be accessed in the previous state. Rust\u0026rsquo;s move semantics make this possible. As long as a type doesn\u0026rsquo;t implement Clone, Copy, or some other means of duplication, there is no coming back from a transition. No other language, not even C++, affords us this guarantee at compile-time.\nImplement the Driver Implement the unimplemented!() methods in lib/pi/src/gpio.rs. The signatures on these items indicate their expected functionality. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to read the GPIO documentation (page 89, section 6 of the BCM2837 ARM Peripherals Manual ) to implement your driver. Remember that you can use cargo check to type-check the library without actually compiling it.\nTesting Your Driver We\u0026rsquo;ll again write code in kern/src/main.rs to ensure that our driver works as expected.\nInstead of reading/writing to raw memory addresses, use your new GPIO driver to set and clear GPIO pin 16. Your code should get a lot cleaner. Compile the kernel, load it onto the MicroSD card as kernel8.img, run it on the Raspberry Pi, and ensure your LED blinks as before.\nNow, connect more LEDs to your Raspberry Pi. Use GPIO pins 5, 6, 13, 19, and 26. Refer to the pin numbering diagram from assignment 0 to determine their physical location. Have your kernel blink all of the LEDs in a pattern of your choice.\nWhich pattern did you choose? (led-pattern)\nWhat pattern did you have your LEDs blink in? If you haven\u0026rsquo;t yet decided, one fun idea is to have them imitate a \u0026ldquo;loading spinner\u0026rdquo; by arranging the LEDs in a circle and turning them on/off in a sequential, circular pattern. Once your GPIO driver is working as expected, proceed to the next subphase.\nSubphase D: UART In this subphase, you will write a device driver for the mini UART device on the Raspberry Pi. You will primarily be working in lib/pi/src/uart.rs and kern/src/main.rs. The mini UART is documented on page 8 and page 10 (sections 2.1 and 2.2) of the BCM2837 ARM Peripherals Manual .\nUART: Universal Asynchronous RX/TX A UART , or universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter, is a device and serial protocol for communicating over two wires. These are the two wires (rx/tx) that you used in phase 1 of lab 0 to connect the UART device on the CP2102 USB module to the UART device on the Pi. You can send any kind of data over UART: text, binaries, images, anything! As an example, in the next subphase, you\u0026rsquo;ll implement a shell by reading from the UART device on the Pi and writing to the UART device on the CP2102 USB module. In phase 3, you\u0026rsquo;ll read from the UART on the Pi to download a binary being sent via the UART on the CP2102 USB module.\nThe UART protocol has several configuration parameters, and both the receiver and transmitter need to be configured identically to communicate. These parameters are:\nData Size: length of a single data frame (8 or 9 bits) Parity Bit: whether to send a parity (checksum) bit after the data Stop Bits: how many bits to use to signal the end of the data (1 or 2) Baud Rate: transmission rate in bits/second The mini UART on the Pi does not support parity bits and only supports 1 stop bit. As such, only the baud rate and data frame length need to be configured. To learn more about UART, see the Basics of UART Communication article.\nImplement the Driver At this point, you have all of the tools to write a device driver without additional background information (congratulations!).\nImplement the mini UART device driver in lib/pi/src/uart.rs. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to complete the definition of the Registers structure. Ensure that you use the Volatile type with the minimal set of capabilities for each register: read-only registers should use ReadVolatile, write-only registers should use WriteVolatile, and reserved space should use Reserved. Then, initialize the device in new() by setting the baud rate to 115200 (a divider of 270) and data length to 8 bits. Finally, implement the remaining unimplemented!() methods and the fmt::Write, io::Read and io::Write traits for MiniUart.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll need to write to the LCR, BAUD, and CNTL registers in new.\nUse your GPIO driver from the previous subphase.\nTesting Your Driver Test your driver by writing a simple \u0026ldquo;echo\u0026rdquo; program in kern/src/main.rs: sit in a hot loop writing out every byte you read in. In pseudocode, this looks like:\nloop { write_byte(read_byte()) } If you want to work in a single tty, just use make qemu to get qemu output to stdio directly.\nAlternatively, use make qemu_screen to run qemu over pty - a pseudo tty.\nThen use screen /dev/\u0026lt;your-path\u0026gt; 115200 in another terminal to communicate over UART.\n(Another terminal can be spawned using docker exec -it \u0026lt;container\u0026gt; bash).\nscreen sends every keypress over the TTY, so if your echo program works correctly, you\u0026rsquo;ll see every character you type.\nExit qemu using Ctrl-a , x. Similarly, exit screen using Ctrl-a, Ctrl-d.\nIt might help to send an extra character or two each time you receive a byte to convince yourself things are working as you expect:\nloop { write_byte(read_byte()) write_str(\u0026#34;\u0026lt;-\u0026#34;) } Once your driver works as expected, proceed to the next subphase.\nSubphase E: The Shell In this subphase, you\u0026rsquo;ll use your new UART driver to implement a simple shell that will be the interface to your operating system. You will be working in kern/src/console.rs, kern/src/shell.rs, and kernel/src/main.rs.\nThe Console To write our shell, we\u0026rsquo;ll need some notion of a global default input and output. Unix and friends typically refer to this is as stdin and stdout; we\u0026rsquo;ll be calling it Console. Console will allow us to implement the kprint! and kprintln! macros, our kernel-space versions of the familiar print! and println!, and give us a default source for reading user input. We\u0026rsquo;ll use Console and these macros to implement our shell.\nTake a peek at kernel/src/console.rs. The file contains an unfinished implementation of the Console struct. Console is a singleton wrapper around a MiniUart: only one instance of Console will ever exist in our kernel. That instance will be globally available, for use anywhere and by anything. This will allow us to read and write to the mini UART without explicitly passing around an instance of MiniUart or Console.\nGlobal Mutability The notion of a globally mutable structure is a scary thought, especially in the face of Rust. After all, Rust doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow more than one mutable reference to a value, so how can we possibly convince it to allow as many as we want? The trick, of course, relies on unsafe. The idea is as follows: we\u0026rsquo;ll tell Rust that we\u0026rsquo;re only going to read a value by using an immutable reference, but what we actually do is use unsafe to \u0026ldquo;cast\u0026rdquo; that immutable reference to a mutable reference. Because we can create as many immutable references as we want, Rust will be none the wiser, and we\u0026rsquo;ll have all of the mutable references we desire!\nSuch a function might look like this:\n// This function must never exist. fn make_mut\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;(value: \u0026amp;T) -\u0026gt; \u0026amp;mut T { unsafe { /* magic */ } } Your alarm bells should be ringing: what we\u0026rsquo;ve proposed so far is wildly unsafe. Recall that we still need to ensure that everything we do in unsafe upholds Rust\u0026rsquo;s rules. What we\u0026rsquo;ve proposed thus far clearly does not. As it stands, we\u0026rsquo;re violating the \u0026ldquo;at most one mutable reference at a time\u0026rdquo; rule. The rule states that at any point in the program, a value should have at most one mutable reference to it.\nThe key insight to maintaining this rule while meeting our requirements is as follows: instead of the compiler checking the rule for us with its borrow and ownership checker, we will ensure that the rule is upheld dynamically, at run-time. As a result, we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to share references to a structure as many times as we want (via an \u0026amp; reference) while also being able to safely retrieve a mutable reference when we need it (via our \u0026amp;T -\u0026gt; \u0026amp;mut T dynamic borrow checking function).\nThere are many concrete implementations of this idea. One such implementation ensures that only one mutable reference is returned at a time using a lock:\nfn lock\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;(value: \u0026amp;T) -\u0026gt; Locked\u0026lt;\u0026amp;mut T\u0026gt; { unsafe { lock(value); cast value to Locked\u0026lt;\u0026amp;mut T\u0026gt; } } impl Drop for Locked\u0026lt;\u0026amp;mut T\u0026gt; { fn drop(\u0026amp;mut self) { unlock(self.value) } } This is known as Mutex in the standard library. Another way is to abort the program if more than one mutable reference is about to be created:\nfn get_mut\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;(value: \u0026amp;T) -\u0026gt; Mut\u0026lt;\u0026amp;mut T\u0026gt; { unsafe { if ref_count(value) != 0 { panic!() } ref_count(value) += 1; cast value to Mut\u0026lt;\u0026amp;mut T\u0026gt; } } impl Drop for Mut\u0026lt;\u0026amp;mut T\u0026gt; { fn drop(\u0026amp;mut self) { ref_count(value) -= 1; } } This is RefCell::borrow_mut() . And yet another is to only return a mutable reference if it is known to be exclusive:\nfn get_mut\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;(value: \u0026amp;T) -\u0026gt; Option\u0026lt;Mut\u0026lt;\u0026amp;mut T\u0026gt;\u0026gt; { unsafe { if ref_count(value) != 0 { None } else { ref_count(value) += 1; Some(cast value to Mut\u0026lt;\u0026amp;mut T\u0026gt;) } } } impl Drop for Mut\u0026lt;\u0026amp;mut T\u0026gt; { fn drop(\u0026amp;mut self) { ref_count(value) -= 1; } } This is RefCell::try_borrow_mut() . All of these examples implement some form of \u0026ldquo;interior mutability\u0026rdquo;: they allow a value to be mutated through an immutable reference. For our Console, we\u0026rsquo;ll be using Mutex to accomplish the same goal. Since the std::Mutex implementation requires operating system support, we\u0026rsquo;ve implemented our own Mutex in kern/src/mutex.rs. Our implementation is correct for now, but we\u0026rsquo;ll need to fix it when we introduce caching or concurrency to continue to uphold Rust\u0026rsquo;s rules. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to understand the Mutex implementation for now, but you should understand how to use one.\nThe global singleton is declared as CONSOLE in kern/src/console.rs. The global variable is used by the kprint! and kprintln! macros defined below below. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve implemented Console, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to use kprint! and kprintln! to print to the console. You\u0026rsquo;ll also be able to use CONSOLE to globally access the console.\nRust also requires static globals to be Sync.\nIn order to store a value of type T in a static global, T must implement Sync. This is because Rust also guarantees data race safety at compile-time. Because global values can be accessed from any thread, Rust must ensure that those accesses are thread-safe. The Send and Sync traits, along with Rust\u0026rsquo;s ownership system, ensure data race freedom.\nWhy should we never return an \u0026amp;mut T directly? (drop-container)\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll notice that every example we\u0026rsquo;ve provided wraps the mutable reference in a container and then implements Drop for that container. What would go wrong if we returned an \u0026amp;mut T directly instead?\nWhere does the write_fmt call go? (write-fmt)\nThe _print helper function calls write_fmt on an instance of MutexGuard\u0026lt;Console\u0026gt;, the return value from Mutex\u0026lt;Console\u0026gt;::lock(). Which type will have its write_fmt method called, and where does the method implementation come from?\nImplement and Test Console implement all of the unimplemented!() methods in kern/src/console.rs. once you\u0026rsquo;ve implemented everything, use the kprint! and kprintln! macros in kern/src/main.rs to write to the console when you receive a character. you can use these macros exactly like print! and println!. use screen /dev/\u0026lt;your-path\u0026gt; 115200 to communicate with your pi and ensure that your kernel works as expected.\nIf this were C\u0026hellip;\nThe fact that we get a println! implementation for free with zero effort is just another advantage to using Rust. If this were C, we\u0026rsquo;d need to implement printf ourselves. In Rust, the compiler provides a generic, abstracted, and safe OS-independent implementation. Whew!\nYour Console implementations should be very short: about a line each.\nImplement the Shell Finished Product You\u0026rsquo;re now ready to implement the shell in kern/src/shell.rs. We\u0026rsquo;ve provided a Command structure for your use. The Command::parse() method provides a simple command-line argument parser, returning a Command struct. The parse method splits the passed in string on spaces and stores all of the non-empty arguments in the args field as a StackVec using the passed in buf as storage. You must implement Command::path() yourself.\nUse all of your available libraries (Command, StackVec, Console via CONSOLE, kprint!, kprintln!, and anything else!) to implement a shell in the shell function. Your shell should print the prefix string on each line it waits for input. In the GIF above, for instance, \u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026quot; is being used as the prefix. Your shell should then read a line of input from the user, parse the line into a command, and attempt to execute it. It should do this ad-infinitum. Since our operating system is only just beginning, we can\u0026rsquo;t run any interesting commands just yet. We can, however, build known commands like echo into the shell.\nTo complete your implementation, your shell should\u0026hellip;\nimplement the echo built-in: echo $a $b $c should print $a $b $c accept both \\r and \\n as \u0026ldquo;enter\u0026rdquo;, marking the end of a line accept both backspace and delete (ASCII 8 and 127) to erase a single character ring the bell (ASCII 7) if an unrecognized non-visible character is sent to it print unknown command: $command for an unknown command $command disallow backspacing through the prefix disallow typing more characters than allowed accept commands at most 512 bytes in length accept at most 64 arguments per command start a new line, without error, with the prefix if the user enters an empty command print error: too many arguments if the user passes in too many arguments Test your implementation by calling your new shell() function in kern/src/main.rs. Minus the \u0026ldquo;SOS\u0026rdquo; banner, you should be able to replicate the GIF above. You should also be able to test all of the requirements we\u0026rsquo;ve set. Once your shell works as expected, revel in your accomplishments. Then, proceed to the next phase.\nA byte literal, b'a' is the u8 ASCII value for a character 'a'.\nUse \\u{b} in a string literal to print any character with ASCII byte value b.\nYou must print both \\r and \\n to begin a new line at the line start.\nTo erase a character, backspace, print a space, then backspace again.\nUse StackVec to buffer the user\u0026rsquo;s input.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll find the core::str::from_utf8() function useful.\nHow does your shell tie the many pieces together? (shell-lookback)\nYour shell makes use of much of the code you\u0026rsquo;ve written. Briefly explain: which pieces does it makes use of and in what way?\n",

        "content": "Introduction In this assignment, you will write useful utilities, libraries, and a simple shell for Raspberry Pi. This is just a single phase of this exercise and we\u0026rsquo;ll be going over the rest of them in the incoming weeks.\nPlease insure you\u0026rsquo;ve setup the environment as described on Tools page .\nThis is the directory structure of our repository. The directories you will be working on this lab section are marked with *.\n. ├── bin : common binaries/utilities ├── ext : external files (e.g., resources for testing) ├── boot : bootloader * ├── kern : the main os kernel * └── lib : required libraries ├── pi * ├── shim ├── stack-vec * ├── ttywrite * ├── volatile * └── xmodem * We recommend the following directory structure for your assignments. Confirm that your directories are properly laid out by running make inside the kern directory now. If all is well, the command will return successfully. If everything is good, feel free to explore the contents of the repository.\nPhase 1: Oxidation In this phase, you will write two libraries, one command-line utility, and review one library. You will be working in the stack-vec, volatile, ttywrite, and xmodem skeleton subdirectories located in lib directory.\nAll projects are being managed with Cargo. You will find the following cargo commands useful:\ncargo build - build an application or library cargo test - test an application or library cargo run - run an application cargo run -- $flags - run an application and pass arbitrary flags to it For more information on using Cargo and how Cargo works, see the Cargo Book .\nSubphase A: StackVec One important facility that operating systems provide is memory allocation. When a C, Rust, Java, Python, or just about any application calls malloc() and malloc() has run out of memory from the operating system, a system call is eventually made to request additional memory. The operating system determines if there is memory available, and if so, fulfills the request for memory.\nMemory allocation is a complicated story.\nIn practice, modern operating systems like Linux have a complicated relationship with memory allocation. For instance, as an optimization, most requests for memory allocation are only \u0026ldquo;virtually\u0026rdquo; handled: no physical memory is actually allocated until the application tries to use the newly allocated memory. Nonetheless, most operating systems aim to provide the illusion that they are allocating memory in the simplistic manner we\u0026rsquo;ve described. Operating systems are master liars.\nHeap-allocated structures like Vec, String, and Box internally call malloc() to allocate memory as necessary. This means that these structures require operating system support to function. In particular, they require the operating system to support memory allocation. We haven\u0026rsquo;t yet started writing our operating system, so clearly there\u0026rsquo;s no memory allocation support for our tiny bare-metal programs to make use of. As such, we can\u0026rsquo;t use heap-allocated structures like Vec until our operating system is further along.\nThis is a real shame because Vec is a nice abstraction! It allows us to think about pushing and poping elements without having to keep track of memory ourselves. How we can get the benefits of the Vec abstraction without supporting memory allocation?\nOne common technique is to pre-allocate memory and then hand that memory to a structure to abstract away. Some ways to pre-allocate memory include using static declarations to set apart memory in the static section of a binary or through stack allocations from local variable declarations. In any case, the allocations is of a fixed, predetermined size.\nIn this subphase, you will implement the StackVec structure, a structure that exposes a Vec-like API when given pre-allocated memory. You will use the StackVec type later in phase 2 when implementing a shell for your Raspberry Pi. You will work in the lib/stack-vec skeleton subdirectory. The subdirectory contains the following files:\nCargo.toml - configuration file for Cargo src/lib.rs - where you will write your code src/tests.rs - tests that will run when cargo test is called The StackVec Interface A StackVec\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; is created by calling StackVec::new(), passing in a mutable slice to values of any type T. The StackVec\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; type implements many of the methods that Vec implements and is used in much the same way. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of a StackVec\u0026lt;u8\u0026gt; being used:\nlet mut storage = [0u8; 10]; let mut vec = StackVec::new(\u0026amp;mut storage); for i in 0..10 { vec.push(i * i).expect(\u0026#34;can push 10 times\u0026#34;); } for (i, v) in vec.iter().enumerate() { assert_eq!(*v, (i * i) as u8); } let last_element = vec.pop().expect(\u0026#34;has elements\u0026#34;); assert_eq!(last_element, 9 * 9); We\u0026rsquo;ve declared the StackVec structure for you already:\npub struct StackVec\u0026lt;\u0026#39;a, T: \u0026#39;a\u0026gt; { storage: \u0026amp;\u0026#39;a mut [T], len: usize } Understanding StackVec The following questions test your understanding about the StackVec interface:\nWhy does push return a Result? (push-fails)\nThe push method from Vec in the standard library has no return value, but the push method from our StackVec does: it returns a Result indicating that it can fail. Why can StackVec::push() fail where Vec::push() does not?\nWhy is the 'a bound on T required? (lifetime)\nstruct StackVec\u0026lt;\u0026#39;a, T\u0026gt; { buffer: \u0026amp;\u0026#39;a mut [T], len: usize } Rust automatically enforces the bound T: 'a and will complain if type T lives shorter than the lifetime 'a. For instance, if T is \u0026amp;'b str and 'b is strictly shorter than 'a, Rust won\u0026rsquo;t allow you to create the instance of StackVec\u0026lt;'a, \u0026amp;'b str\u0026gt;.\nWhy is the bound required? What could go wrong if the bound wasn\u0026rsquo;t enforced by Rust?\nWhy does StackVec require T: Clone to pop()? (clone-for-pop)\nThe pop method from Vec\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; in the standard library is implemented for all T, but the pop method from our StackVec is only implemented when T implements the Clone trait. Why might that be? What goes wrong when the bound is removed?\nImplementing StackVec Implement all of the unimplemented!() StackVec methods in stack-vec/src/lib.rs. Each method is documented in the source code. We have also provided tests in src/tests.rs that help ensure that your implementations are correct. You can run these tests with cargo test. You\u0026rsquo;ll also need to implement the Deref, DerefMut, and IntoIterator traits for StackVec as well as the IntoIterator trait for \u0026amp;StackVec for all of the cargo test tests to pass. Once you feel confident that you implementation is correct and have answered this subphase\u0026rsquo;s questions, proceed to the next subphase.\nWhich tests make use of the Deref implementations? (deref-in-tests)\nRead through the tests we have provided in src/tests.rs. Which tests would fail to compile if the Deref implementation did not exist? What about the DerefMut implementation? Why?\nOur unit tests are incomplete!\nOur unit tests provide a baseline truth, but they are not complete! We will run additional tests when we grade your assignment. You may wish to find the gaps in our tests and add additional tests of your own to fill them.\nSubphase B: volatile In this subphase, you will learn about volatile memory accesses, read the source code in the volatile skeleton subdirectory, and answer questions related to the source code. You won\u0026rsquo;t be writing any code in this subphase.\nLike operating systems, compilers are masters at making things appear as if they\u0026rsquo;re doing what you think they\u0026rsquo;re doing when in reality, they\u0026rsquo;re really doing something entirely different for the sake of optimization. One such optimization is dead-access elimination: compilers remove memory accesses (reads and writes) when they can prove doing so has no observable effect on the program\u0026rsquo;s execution. For instance, consider the following program:\nfn f() { let mut x = 0; let y = \u0026amp;mut x; *y = 10; } The compiler can completely eliminate the write to *y by reasoning that *y is never read after it\u0026rsquo;s written. The compiler concludes that as a result, the write cannot possibly effect the program, and eliminates it in the compiled binary. For the same reason, it can then proceed to eliminate the declaration for y, the declaration for x, and calls to f() entirely.\nThese kinds of optimizations are almost exclusively beneficial: they speed up our programs without affecting their outcome. But sometimes these optimizations can have unintended consequences. Say, for example, that y was pointing to a write-only memory-mapped register. Then, writes to *y will have observable effects without having to read *y thereafter. If the compiler is not aware of this, it will optimize away these writes, and our program will not function correctly.\nHow can we force the compiler to keep around reads and writes that appear to have no effects at the source code level? This is where volatile memory accesses come in: the compiler promises not to optimize away volatile memory accesses. So if we want to ensure a read or write occurs at runtime, we must perform a volatile memory access.\nRusty volatile In Rust, we use the read_volatile and write_volatile methods to perform volatile reads and writes to a raw pointer.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s a raw pointer?\nBy now you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with references (\u0026amp;T and \u0026amp;mut T). A raw pointer in Rust (*const T and *mut T) is a \u0026ldquo;reference\u0026rdquo; that isn\u0026rsquo;t tracked with lifetimes by Rust\u0026rsquo;s borrow checker. Because of this, read or writes to these pointers may be invalid, just as in C. Rust considers them unsafe, and code that reads or writes them must be annotated with unsafe to indicate this. You can read more about raw pointers in the rustdocs .\nCalling read_volatile and write_volatile every time we want to perform a volatile read or write is error prone and frustrating. Thankfully Rust provides us the tools to make this easier and safer. Ideally we can simply declare a pointer as volatile (as in C) and ensure that every read or write thereafter is volatile. Even better, we should be able declare a pointer as read-only, write-only (unlike in C), or read/write and ensure only the appropriate memory accesses can be made.\nIntroducing Volatile, ReadVolatile, WriteVolatile, and UniqueVolatile The volatile crate in the volatile/ skeleton subdirectory implements these four types that allow us to do just this. Read the documentation for these types now by running cargo doc --open inside of the volatile/ directory.\nWhy does Unique\u0026lt;Volatile\u0026gt; exist? (unique-volatile)\nBoth Volatile and Unique\u0026lt;Volatile\u0026gt; allow read/write volatile accesses to an underlying pointer. According to the documentation, what is the difference between these two types?\nNow open the source code in src/lib.rs, src/traits.rs, and src/macros.rs. Read through the source code to the best of your abilities. When you\u0026rsquo;re ready, answer the following questions. Once you have answered these questions, you\u0026rsquo;re ready to move on to the next subphase.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s with #[repr(C)]?\nThe #[repr(C)] annotation forces Rust to lay out the structure\u0026rsquo;s fields in the same way that C would. In general, Rust optimizes the order and padding between fields of structures in an unspecified way. When we cast a raw address to a pointer to a structure, we typically have a very specific memory layout in mind. The #[repr(C)] annotation lets us confide that Rust will arrange the structure as we intend it to, not as it wishes.\nHow are read-only and write-only accesses enforced? (enforcing)\nThe ReadVolatile and WriteVolatile types make it impossible to write and read, respectively, the underlying pointer. How do they accomplish this?\nWhat do the macros do? (macros)\nWhat do the readable!, writeable!, and readable_writeable! macros do?\nSubphase C: xmodem In this subphase, you will implement the XMODEM file transfer protocol in the xmodem library in the xmodem/ skeleton subdirectory. You will primarily be working in xmodem/src/lib.rs.\nXMODEM is a simple file transfer protocol originally developed in 1977. It features packet checksums, cancellation, and automatic retries. It is widely implemented and used for transfers through serial interfaces. Its best feature, however, is its simplicity. For more about its history, see the XMODEM Wikipedia article .\nWe will use the XMODEM protocol to transfer files to the Raspberry Pi. While we could use existing implementations of the XMODEM protocol to send data to the Pi, we will still need to write our own receiver. So, while we\u0026rsquo;re at it, we\u0026rsquo;ll be implementing XMODEM transmission as well.\nThe Protocol The XMODEM protocol is described in detail in the Understanding The X-Modem File Transfer Protocol txt file. We describe it again here, for posterity.\nDo not base your implementation off of Wikipedia\u0026rsquo;s explanation!\nWhile Wikipedia\u0026rsquo;s explanation is helpful at a high level, many of the details presented there are different from the protocol we\u0026rsquo;ll be implementing here. As such, do not use the article as a reference for this subphase.\nXMODEM is a binary protocol: bytes are sent and received in the raw. It is also \u0026ldquo;half duplex\u0026rdquo;: at any point in time, either the sender or receiver is sending data, but never both. Finally it is packet-based: data is separated into 128 byte chunks known as packets. The protocol dictates which bytes are sent when, what they mean, and how they\u0026rsquo;re interpreted.\nFirst, we define a few constants:\nconst SOH: u8 = 0x01; const EOT: u8 = 0x04; const ACK: u8 = 0x06; const NAK: u8 = 0x15; const CAN: u8 = 0x18; To start the file transfer, the receiver sends a NAK byte while the sender waits for a NAK byte. Once the sender has received the NAK byte, packet transmission begins. The receiver only sends a NAK byte to begin the file transfer, not once for every packet.\nOnce file transfer has begun, each packet\u0026rsquo;s transmission and reception is identical. Packets are numbered in sequential order starting at 1 and wrap around to 0 after 255.\nXMODEM protocol diagram To send a packet, the sender:\nSends an SOH byte.\nSends the packet number.\nSends the 1s complement of the packet number (255 - $packet_number).\nSends the packet itself.\nSends the packet checksum.\nThe checksum is the sum of all of the bytes in the packet mod 256. Reads a byte from the receiver.\nIf the byte is NAK, transmission for the same packet is retried up to 10 times. If the byte is ACK, the next packet is sent. The receive a packet, the receiver performs the inverse:\nWaits for an SOH or EOT byte from the sender.\nIf a different byte is received, the receiver cancels the transfer. If an EOT byte is received, the receiver performs end of transmission. Reads the next byte and compares it to the current packet number.\nIf the wrong packet number is received, the receiver cancels the transfer. Reads the next byte and compares it to the 1s complement of the packet number.\nIf the wrong number is received, the receiver cancels the transfer. Reads a packet (128 bytes) from the sender.\nComputes the checksum for the packet.\nThe checksum is the sum of all of the bytes in the packet mod 256. Reads the next byte and compares it to the computed checksum.\nIf the checksum differs, sends a NAK byte and retries reception for the same packet. If the checksum is the same, sends an ACK byte and receives the next packet. To cancel a transfer, a CAN byte is sent by either the receiver or sender. When either side receives a CAN byte, it errors out, aborting the connection.\nTo end the transmission, the sender:\nSends an EOT byte. Waits for a NAK byte. If a different byte is received, the sender errors out. Sends a second EOT byte. Waits for an ACK byte. If a different byte is received, the sender errors out. To end the transmission, the receiver performs the following after receiving the first EOT:\nSends a NAK byte. Waits for a second EOT byte. If a different byte is received, the receiver cancels the transfer. Sends an ACK byte. Implementing XMODEM We have provided an unfinished implementation of the XMODEM protocol in the xmodem skeleton subdirectory. Your task is to complete the implementation by writing the expect_byte, expect_byte_or_cancel, read_packet, and write_packet methods in src/lib.rs. Your implementations should make use of the internal state of the Xmodem type: packet and started. We recommend reading over the existing code before starting.\nYou should begin by implementing the expect_byte and expect_byte_or_cancel methods. You should then make use of all four of the helper methods (including read_byte and write_byte) to implement read_packet and write_packet. To see how these methods are used, read the transmit and receive implementations which transmit or receive a complete data stream using XMODEM via these methods. Be mindful of the specifications in the doc-comments. You can test your implementation using cargo test. Once you are confident that your implementation is correct, proceed to the next subphase.\nDo not use any additional items from std.\nYour implementation should only use items from shim::io. It should not use other items from std or any other libraries.\nOur reference implementations for {read,write}_packet are roughly 43 lines of code each.\nThe io::Read and io::Write rustdocs will be useful.\nUse the ? operator generously.\nThe test source code can be a helpful guide.\nYou can use ioerr! macro to make and return a new io::Error easily. Please refer shim/src/macros.rs to find more macros which can be useful.\nSubphase D: ttywrite In this subphase, you will write a command line utility, ttywrite, that will allow you to send data to your Raspberry Pi in the raw or via the XMODEM protocol. You will use your xmodem library from the previous subphase in your implementation. You will write your code in ttywrite/src/main.rs. To test your ttywrite implementation, use the provided test.sh script.\nWhat is a serial device?\nA serial device is any device that accepts communication one bit at a time. This is known as serial communication. In contrast, in parallel communication multiple bits are being transferred at any point in time in parallel. We will be communicating with our Raspberry Pi via its UART device, a serial communication device.\nWhat is a TTY?\nA TTY is a \u0026ldquo;teletypewriter\u0026rdquo;. It is a vestigial term that was adopted in computing to describe computer terminals. The term later become more general, coming to describe any device intended to be communicated with over serial. For this reason, your computer calls the device mapping to your Raspberry Pi a TTY.\nCommand-Line Interface The skeleton code we have provided for ttywrite already parses and validates command-line arguments. To do so, it uses the structopt crate from crates.io which itself uses clap . You\u0026rsquo;ll notice that we list it as a dependency in the Cargo.toml file. structopt works through code generation. We simply annotate a structure and its fields with a declaration of our command-line arguments and structopt generates the code to actually parse the command-line flags.\nTo see the interface that structopt generates, call the application with --help. Remember that you can pass arbitrary flags when using cargo run: cargo run -- --help. Take a look at the interface now. Then, take a look at the Opt structure in main.rs and compare the interface with its definition.\nWhat happens when a flag\u0026rsquo;s input is invalid? (invalid)\nTry passing in some invalid values for flags. For instance, it should not be possible to set -f to idk. How does structopt know to reject invalid values?\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll notice that there are plenty of options. All of these correspond to settings available on a serial device. For now it\u0026rsquo;s not important to know exactly what these settings do.\nTalking to a Serial Device In main, you\u0026rsquo;ll see a call to serial::open . This is calling the open function from the serial crate, also on crates.io . This open function returns a TTYPort which allows you to read and write to the serial device (via its io::Read and io::Write trait implementations) as well as read and set settings on a serial device (via its SerialDevice trait implementation).\nWriting the Code Implement the ttywrite utility. Your implementation should set all of the appropriate settings passed in via the command-line stored in the opt variable in main. It should read from stdin if no input file is passed in or from the input file if one is passed in. It should write the input data to the passed in serial device. If the -r flag is set, it should send the data as it is. Otherwise, you should use your xmodem implementation from the previous subphase to send the data using the XMODEM protocol. You should print the number of bytes sent on a successful transmission.\nTo transmit using the XMODEM protocol, your code should use either the Xmodem::transmit or Xmodem::transmit_with_progress methods from the xmodem library. We recommend using transmit_with_progress so that your utility indicates progress throughput the transmission. In its simplest form, this might look as follows:\nfn progress_fn(progress: Progress) { println!(\u0026#34;Progress: {:?}\u0026#34;, progress); } Xmodem::transmit_with_progress(data, to, progress_fn) You can test the baseline correctness of your implementation using the test.sh script in the ttywrite directory. When your implementation is at least somewhat correct, you will see the following when the script is run:\nOpening PTYs... Running test 1/10. wrote 333 bytes to input ... Running test 10/10. wrote 232 bytes to input SUCCESS You can retrieve a handle to stdin with io::stdin() .\nYou may find the io::copy() function useful.\nThe main() function in our reference implementation is roughly 35 lines of code.\nKeep the TTYPort documentation open while writing your code.\nWhy does the test.sh script always set -r? (bad-tests)\nThe test.sh script that we have provided always uses the -r flag; it doesn\u0026rsquo;t test that your utility uses the XMODEM protocol when it is asked to. Why might that be? What does the XMODEM protocol expect that sending data in the raw doesn\u0026rsquo;t that makes testing its functionality difficult?\nInstalling ttywrite utility After finish writing the ttywrite utility, install the tool with cargo install --path . --locked command. This command will be used later to communicate with the bootloader.\n",

This is done using docker so that everyone has similar setups.\nWe recommend you to stick to this ubuntu version unless you might face some configuration issues.\nYou will also be using use QEMU, an x86 emulator for easier executing and debugging process instead of using real raspberry pi board.\nThis section has the information you’ll need to setup the environment.\nDocker You may install Ubuntu 20.04 on WSL and skip to the next part .\nYou first need to install docker for your OS:\nWindows Mac Linux Spin up Container Please ensure that your installation location for Docker has atleast 10GB of free space.\nGo to your working directory where you\u0026rsquo;ll be working inside and run:\ndocker run -it --name os_labs -v $(pwd):/root/workdir:Z ubuntu:20.04 Now you\u0026rsquo;ll be inside the container, where you\u0026rsquo;ll see a prompt like this:\nroot@e8f10931f506:/# Your working directory will now be available in /root/workdir/.\nFor resuming the container after you\u0026rsquo;ve exited:\ndocker start -i os_labs Anyone with SELINUX enabled distros like Fedora may face some problems with shared dirs between the host and the containers. Please contact the TAs if you get stuck somewhere.\nGetting Repository and Installing Dependencies Please ensure that whatever directory you decide to keep the lab in, it has atleast 10GB of free space.\n# Download the repository git clone https://github.com/pratyush3757/cs330_os.git --origin skeleton rustos cd rustos/ git switch lab3 # Install dependencies ./bin/setup.sh # Update environment source ~/.bashrc You\u0026rsquo;re all set to go back to the lab document if the setup.sh runs correctly and says [!] Setup complete.\nContact a TA if it throws an error.\nReference This section has the information for the various tools you\u0026rsquo;ll be using during the labs.\nWe will be updating this section with more required info as the labs go on.\nMakefile Our Makefile includes a number of targets to test and run our OS in various ways.\nmake Build kernel in release mode. The result executable and binary will be located under build/ subdirectory. make debug Build Rust libraries or kernel in debug mode. make check Check a local package and all of its dependencies for errors. make qemu Start QEMU with the executable file under build/ subdirectory generated by make command. QEMU will generate a detailed log of assembly code of the guest. To exit QEMU, press Ctrl-a x. make objdump Disassemble the executable file generated by make. make nm List all symbols in the executable file generated by make. make clean Clean the directory. make install Install compiled kernel image to SD card. (Not needed until we have physical RPi devices) make test Execute all unit and integration tests and build examples of a local package. QEMU Emulator QEMU (manual ) is a modern and fast PC emulator. We are providing a pre-built QEMU binary to emulate raspberry pi 3+ board as /bin/qemu-system-aarch64.\nQEMU includes a built-in monitor that can inspect and modify the machine state in useful ways. To enter the monitor, press Ctrl-a c in the terminal running QEMU. Press Ctrl-a c again to switch back to the serial console.\nFor a complete reference to the monitor commands, see the QEMU manual . Here are some particularly useful commands:\nxp/Nx paddr Display a hex dump of N words starting at physical address paddr. If N is omitted, it defaults to 1. This is the physical memory analogue of GDB’s x command. info registers Display a full dump of the machine’s internal register state. In particular, this includes the machine’s hidden segment state for the segment selectors and the local, global, and interrupt descriptor tables, plus the task register. This hidden state is the information the virtual CPU read from the GDT/LDT when the segment selector was loaded. info mem Display mapped virtual memory and permissions. For example, ef7c0000-ef800000 00040000 urw efbf8000-efc00000 00008000 -rw tells us that the 0x00040000 bytes of memory from 0xef7c0000 to 0xef800000 are mapped read/write and user-accessible, while the memory from 0xefbf8000 to 0xefc00000 is mapped read/write, but only kernel-accessible.
