        "content": "Introduction In this assignment, you will write useful utilities, libraries, and a simple shell for Raspberry Pi. This is just a single phase of this exercise and we\u0026rsquo;ll be going over the rest of them in the incoming weeks.\nPlease insure you\u0026rsquo;ve setup the environment as described on Tools page .\nThis is the directory structure of our repository. The directories you will be working on this lab section are marked with *.\n. ├── bin : common binaries/utilities ├── ext : external files (e.g., resources for testing) ├── boot : bootloader * ├── kern : the main os kernel * └── lib : required libraries ├── pi * ├── shim ├── stack-vec * ├── ttywrite * ├── volatile * └── xmodem * We recommend the following directory structure for your assignments. Confirm that your directories are properly laid out by running make inside the kern directory now. If all is well, the command will return successfully. If everything is good, feel free to explore the contents of the repository.\nPhase 1: Oxidation In this phase, you will write two libraries, one command-line utility, and review one library. You will be working in the stack-vec, volatile, ttywrite, and xmodem skeleton subdirectories located in lib directory.\nAll projects are being managed with Cargo. You will find the following cargo commands useful:\ncargo build - build an application or library cargo test - test an application or library cargo run - run an application cargo run -- $flags - run an application and pass arbitrary flags to it For more information on using Cargo and how Cargo works, see the Cargo Book .\nSubphase A: StackVec One important facility that operating systems provide is memory allocation. When a C, Rust, Java, Python, or just about any application calls malloc() and malloc() has run out of memory from the operating system, a system call is eventually made to request additional memory. The operating system determines if there is memory available, and if so, fulfills the request for memory.\nMemory allocation is a complicated story.\nIn practice, modern operating systems like Linux have a complicated relationship with memory allocation. For instance, as an optimization, most requests for memory allocation are only \u0026ldquo;virtually\u0026rdquo; handled: no physical memory is actually allocated until the application tries to use the newly allocated memory. Nonetheless, most operating systems aim to provide the illusion that they are allocating memory in the simplistic manner we\u0026rsquo;ve described. Operating systems are master liars.\nHeap-allocated structures like Vec, String, and Box internally call malloc() to allocate memory as necessary. This means that these structures require operating system support to function. In particular, they require the operating system to support memory allocation. We haven\u0026rsquo;t yet started writing our operating system, so clearly there\u0026rsquo;s no memory allocation support for our tiny bare-metal programs to make use of. As such, we can\u0026rsquo;t use heap-allocated structures like Vec until our operating system is further along.\nThis is a real shame because Vec is a nice abstraction! It allows us to think about pushing and poping elements without having to keep track of memory ourselves. How we can get the benefits of the Vec abstraction without supporting memory allocation?\nOne common technique is to pre-allocate memory and then hand that memory to a structure to abstract away. Some ways to pre-allocate memory include using static declarations to set apart memory in the static section of a binary or through stack allocations from local variable declarations. In any case, the allocations is of a fixed, predetermined size.\nIn this subphase, you will implement the StackVec structure, a structure that exposes a Vec-like API when given pre-allocated memory. You will use the StackVec type later in phase 2 when implementing a shell for your Raspberry Pi. You will work in the lib/stack-vec skeleton subdirectory. The subdirectory contains the following files:\nCargo.toml - configuration file for Cargo src/lib.rs - where you will write your code src/tests.rs - tests that will run when cargo test is called The StackVec Interface A StackVec\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; is created by calling StackVec::new(), passing in a mutable slice to values of any type T. The StackVec\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; type implements many of the methods that Vec implements and is used in much the same way. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of a StackVec\u0026lt;u8\u0026gt; being used:\nlet mut storage = [0u8; 10]; let mut vec = StackVec::new(\u0026amp;mut storage); for i in 0..10 { vec.push(i * i).expect(\u0026#34;can push 10 times\u0026#34;); } for (i, v) in vec.iter().enumerate() { assert_eq!(*v, (i * i) as u8); } let last_element = vec.pop().expect(\u0026#34;has elements\u0026#34;); assert_eq!(last_element, 9 * 9); We\u0026rsquo;ve declared the StackVec structure for you already:\npub struct StackVec\u0026lt;\u0026#39;a, T: \u0026#39;a\u0026gt; { storage: \u0026amp;\u0026#39;a mut [T], len: usize } Understanding StackVec The following questions test your understanding about the StackVec interface:\nWhy does push return a Result? (push-fails)\nThe push method from Vec in the standard library has no return value, but the push method from our StackVec does: it returns a Result indicating that it can fail. Why can StackVec::push() fail where Vec::push() does not?\nWhy is the 'a bound on T required? (lifetime)\nstruct StackVec\u0026lt;\u0026#39;a, T\u0026gt; { buffer: \u0026amp;\u0026#39;a mut [T], len: usize } Rust automatically enforces the bound T: 'a and will complain if type T lives shorter than the lifetime 'a. For instance, if T is \u0026amp;'b str and 'b is strictly shorter than 'a, Rust won\u0026rsquo;t allow you to create the instance of StackVec\u0026lt;'a, \u0026amp;'b str\u0026gt;.\nWhy is the bound required? What could go wrong if the bound wasn\u0026rsquo;t enforced by Rust?\nWhy does StackVec require T: Clone to pop()? (clone-for-pop)\nThe pop method from Vec\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; in the standard library is implemented for all T, but the pop method from our StackVec is only implemented when T implements the Clone trait. Why might that be? What goes wrong when the bound is removed?\nImplementing StackVec Implement all of the unimplemented!() StackVec methods in stack-vec/src/lib.rs. Each method is documented in the source code. We have also provided tests in src/tests.rs that help ensure that your implementations are correct. You can run these tests with cargo test. You\u0026rsquo;ll also need to implement the Deref, DerefMut, and IntoIterator traits for StackVec as well as the IntoIterator trait for \u0026amp;StackVec for all of the cargo test tests to pass. Once you feel confident that you implementation is correct and have answered this subphase\u0026rsquo;s questions, proceed to the next subphase.\nWhich tests make use of the Deref implementations? (deref-in-tests)\nRead through the tests we have provided in src/tests.rs. Which tests would fail to compile if the Deref implementation did not exist? What about the DerefMut implementation? Why?\nOur unit tests are incomplete!\nOur unit tests provide a baseline truth, but they are not complete! We will run additional tests when we grade your assignment. You may wish to find the gaps in our tests and add additional tests of your own to fill them.\nSubphase B: volatile In this subphase, you will learn about volatile memory accesses, read the source code in the volatile skeleton subdirectory, and answer questions related to the source code. You won\u0026rsquo;t be writing any code in this subphase.\nLike operating systems, compilers are masters at making things appear as if they\u0026rsquo;re doing what you think they\u0026rsquo;re doing when in reality, they\u0026rsquo;re really doing something entirely different for the sake of optimization. One such optimization is dead-access elimination: compilers remove memory accesses (reads and writes) when they can prove doing so has no observable effect on the program\u0026rsquo;s execution. For instance, consider the following program:\nfn f() { let mut x = 0; let y = \u0026amp;mut x; *y = 10; } The compiler can completely eliminate the write to *y by reasoning that *y is never read after it\u0026rsquo;s written. The compiler concludes that as a result, the write cannot possibly effect the program, and eliminates it in the compiled binary. For the same reason, it can then proceed to eliminate the declaration for y, the declaration for x, and calls to f() entirely.\nThese kinds of optimizations are almost exclusively beneficial: they speed up our programs without affecting their outcome. But sometimes these optimizations can have unintended consequences. Say, for example, that y was pointing to a write-only memory-mapped register. Then, writes to *y will have observable effects without having to read *y thereafter. If the compiler is not aware of this, it will optimize away these writes, and our program will not function correctly.\nHow can we force the compiler to keep around reads and writes that appear to have no effects at the source code level? This is where volatile memory accesses come in: the compiler promises not to optimize away volatile memory accesses. So if we want to ensure a read or write occurs at runtime, we must perform a volatile memory access.\nRusty volatile In Rust, we use the read_volatile and write_volatile methods to perform volatile reads and writes to a raw pointer.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s a raw pointer?\nBy now you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with references (\u0026amp;T and \u0026amp;mut T). A raw pointer in Rust (*const T and *mut T) is a \u0026ldquo;reference\u0026rdquo; that isn\u0026rsquo;t tracked with lifetimes by Rust\u0026rsquo;s borrow checker. Because of this, read or writes to these pointers may be invalid, just as in C. Rust considers them unsafe, and code that reads or writes them must be annotated with unsafe to indicate this. You can read more about raw pointers in the rustdocs .\nCalling read_volatile and write_volatile every time we want to perform a volatile read or write is error prone and frustrating. Thankfully Rust provides us the tools to make this easier and safer. Ideally we can simply declare a pointer as volatile (as in C) and ensure that every read or write thereafter is volatile. Even better, we should be able declare a pointer as read-only, write-only (unlike in C), or read/write and ensure only the appropriate memory accesses can be made.\nIntroducing Volatile, ReadVolatile, WriteVolatile, and UniqueVolatile The volatile crate in the volatile/ skeleton subdirectory implements these four types that allow us to do just this. Read the documentation for these types now by running cargo doc --open inside of the volatile/ directory.\nWhy does Unique\u0026lt;Volatile\u0026gt; exist? (unique-volatile)\nBoth Volatile and Unique\u0026lt;Volatile\u0026gt; allow read/write volatile accesses to an underlying pointer. According to the documentation, what is the difference between these two types?\nNow open the source code in src/lib.rs, src/traits.rs, and src/macros.rs. Read through the source code to the best of your abilities. When you\u0026rsquo;re ready, answer the following questions. Once you have answered these questions, you\u0026rsquo;re ready to move on to the next subphase.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s with #[repr(C)]?\nThe #[repr(C)] annotation forces Rust to lay out the structure\u0026rsquo;s fields in the same way that C would. In general, Rust optimizes the order and padding between fields of structures in an unspecified way. When we cast a raw address to a pointer to a structure, we typically have a very specific memory layout in mind. The #[repr(C)] annotation lets us confide that Rust will arrange the structure as we intend it to, not as it wishes.\nHow are read-only and write-only accesses enforced? (enforcing)\nThe ReadVolatile and WriteVolatile types make it impossible to write and read, respectively, the underlying pointer. How do they accomplish this?\nWhat do the macros do? (macros)\nWhat do the readable!, writeable!, and readable_writeable! macros do?\nSubphase C: xmodem In this subphase, you will implement the XMODEM file transfer protocol in the xmodem library in the xmodem/ skeleton subdirectory. You will primarily be working in xmodem/src/lib.rs.\nXMODEM is a simple file transfer protocol originally developed in 1977. It features packet checksums, cancellation, and automatic retries. It is widely implemented and used for transfers through serial interfaces. Its best feature, however, is its simplicity. For more about its history, see the XMODEM Wikipedia article .\nWe will use the XMODEM protocol to transfer files to the Raspberry Pi. While we could use existing implementations of the XMODEM protocol to send data to the Pi, we will still need to write our own receiver. So, while we\u0026rsquo;re at it, we\u0026rsquo;ll be implementing XMODEM transmission as well.\nThe Protocol The XMODEM protocol is described in detail in the Understanding The X-Modem File Transfer Protocol txt file. We describe it again here, for posterity.\nDo not base your implementation off of Wikipedia\u0026rsquo;s explanation!\nWhile Wikipedia\u0026rsquo;s explanation is helpful at a high level, many of the details presented there are different from the protocol we\u0026rsquo;ll be implementing here. As such, do not use the article as a reference for this subphase.\nXMODEM is a binary protocol: bytes are sent and received in the raw. It is also \u0026ldquo;half duplex\u0026rdquo;: at any point in time, either the sender or receiver is sending data, but never both. Finally it is packet-based: data is separated into 128 byte chunks known as packets. The protocol dictates which bytes are sent when, what they mean, and how they\u0026rsquo;re interpreted.\nFirst, we define a few constants:\nconst SOH: u8 = 0x01; const EOT: u8 = 0x04; const ACK: u8 = 0x06; const NAK: u8 = 0x15; const CAN: u8 = 0x18; To start the file transfer, the receiver sends a NAK byte while the sender waits for a NAK byte. Once the sender has received the NAK byte, packet transmission begins. The receiver only sends a NAK byte to begin the file transfer, not once for every packet.\nOnce file transfer has begun, each packet\u0026rsquo;s transmission and reception is identical. Packets are numbered in sequential order starting at 1 and wrap around to 0 after 255.\nXMODEM protocol diagram To send a packet, the sender:\nSends an SOH byte.\nSends the packet number.\nSends the 1s complement of the packet number (255 - $packet_number).\nSends the packet itself.\nSends the packet checksum.\nThe checksum is the sum of all of the bytes in the packet mod 256. Reads a byte from the receiver.\nIf the byte is NAK, transmission for the same packet is retried up to 10 times. If the byte is ACK, the next packet is sent. The receive a packet, the receiver performs the inverse:\nWaits for an SOH or EOT byte from the sender.\nIf a different byte is received, the receiver cancels the transfer. If an EOT byte is received, the receiver performs end of transmission. Reads the next byte and compares it to the current packet number.\nIf the wrong packet number is received, the receiver cancels the transfer. Reads the next byte and compares it to the 1s complement of the packet number.\nIf the wrong number is received, the receiver cancels the transfer. Reads a packet (128 bytes) from the sender.\nComputes the checksum for the packet.\nThe checksum is the sum of all of the bytes in the packet mod 256. Reads the next byte and compares it to the computed checksum.\nIf the checksum differs, sends a NAK byte and retries reception for the same packet. If the checksum is the same, sends an ACK byte and receives the next packet. To cancel a transfer, a CAN byte is sent by either the receiver or sender. When either side receives a CAN byte, it errors out, aborting the connection.\nTo end the transmission, the sender:\nSends an EOT byte. Waits for a NAK byte. If a different byte is received, the sender errors out. Sends a second EOT byte. Waits for an ACK byte. If a different byte is received, the sender errors out. To end the transmission, the receiver performs the following after receiving the first EOT:\nSends a NAK byte. Waits for a second EOT byte. If a different byte is received, the receiver cancels the transfer. Sends an ACK byte. Implementing XMODEM We have provided an unfinished implementation of the XMODEM protocol in the xmodem skeleton subdirectory. Your task is to complete the implementation by writing the expect_byte, expect_byte_or_cancel, read_packet, and write_packet methods in src/lib.rs. Your implementations should make use of the internal state of the Xmodem type: packet and started. We recommend reading over the existing code before starting.\nYou should begin by implementing the expect_byte and expect_byte_or_cancel methods. You should then make use of all four of the helper methods (including read_byte and write_byte) to implement read_packet and write_packet. To see how these methods are used, read the transmit and receive implementations which transmit or receive a complete data stream using XMODEM via these methods. Be mindful of the specifications in the doc-comments. You can test your implementation using cargo test. Once you are confident that your implementation is correct, proceed to the next subphase.\nDo not use any additional items from std.\nYour implementation should only use items from shim::io. It should not use other items from std or any other libraries.\nOur reference implementations for {read,write}_packet are roughly 43 lines of code each.\nThe io::Read and io::Write rustdocs will be useful.\nUse the ? operator generously.\nThe test source code can be a helpful guide.\nYou can use ioerr! macro to make and return a new io::Error easily. Please refer shim/src/macros.rs to find more macros which can be useful.\nSubphase D: ttywrite In this subphase, you will write a command line utility, ttywrite, that will allow you to send data to your Raspberry Pi in the raw or via the XMODEM protocol. You will use your xmodem library from the previous subphase in your implementation. You will write your code in ttywrite/src/main.rs. To test your ttywrite implementation, use the provided test.sh script.\nWhat is a serial device?\nA serial device is any device that accepts communication one bit at a time. This is known as serial communication. In contrast, in parallel communication multiple bits are being transferred at any point in time in parallel. We will be communicating with our Raspberry Pi via its UART device, a serial communication device.\nWhat is a TTY?\nA TTY is a \u0026ldquo;teletypewriter\u0026rdquo;. It is a vestigial term that was adopted in computing to describe computer terminals. The term later become more general, coming to describe any device intended to be communicated with over serial. For this reason, your computer calls the device mapping to your Raspberry Pi a TTY.\nCommand-Line Interface The skeleton code we have provided for ttywrite already parses and validates command-line arguments. To do so, it uses the structopt crate from crates.io which itself uses clap . You\u0026rsquo;ll notice that we list it as a dependency in the Cargo.toml file. structopt works through code generation. We simply annotate a structure and its fields with a declaration of our command-line arguments and structopt generates the code to actually parse the command-line flags.\nTo see the interface that structopt generates, call the application with --help. Remember that you can pass arbitrary flags when using cargo run: cargo run -- --help. Take a look at the interface now. Then, take a look at the Opt structure in main.rs and compare the interface with its definition.\nWhat happens when a flag\u0026rsquo;s input is invalid? (invalid)\nTry passing in some invalid values for flags. For instance, it should not be possible to set -f to idk. How does structopt know to reject invalid values?\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll notice that there are plenty of options. All of these correspond to settings available on a serial device. For now it\u0026rsquo;s not important to know exactly what these settings do.\nTalking to a Serial Device In main, you\u0026rsquo;ll see a call to serial::open . This is calling the open function from the serial crate, also on crates.io . This open function returns a TTYPort which allows you to read and write to the serial device (via its io::Read and io::Write trait implementations) as well as read and set settings on a serial device (via its SerialDevice trait implementation).\nWriting the Code Implement the ttywrite utility. Your implementation should set all of the appropriate settings passed in via the command-line stored in the opt variable in main. It should read from stdin if no input file is passed in or from the input file if one is passed in. It should write the input data to the passed in serial device. If the -r flag is set, it should send the data as it is. Otherwise, you should use your xmodem implementation from the previous subphase to send the data using the XMODEM protocol. You should print the number of bytes sent on a successful transmission.\nTo transmit using the XMODEM protocol, your code should use either the Xmodem::transmit or Xmodem::transmit_with_progress methods from the xmodem library. We recommend using transmit_with_progress so that your utility indicates progress throughput the transmission. In its simplest form, this might look as follows:\nfn progress_fn(progress: Progress) { println!(\u0026#34;Progress: {:?}\u0026#34;, progress); } Xmodem::transmit_with_progress(data, to, progress_fn) You can test the baseline correctness of your implementation using the test.sh script in the ttywrite directory. When your implementation is at least somewhat correct, you will see the following when the script is run:\nOpening PTYs... Running test 1/10. wrote 333 bytes to input ... Running test 10/10. wrote 232 bytes to input SUCCESS You can retrieve a handle to stdin with io::stdin() .\nYou may find the io::copy() function useful.\nThe main() function in our reference implementation is roughly 35 lines of code.\nKeep the TTYPort documentation open while writing your code.\nWhy does the test.sh script always set -r? (bad-tests)\nThe test.sh script that we have provided always uses the -r flag; it doesn\u0026rsquo;t test that your utility uses the XMODEM protocol when it is asked to. Why might that be? What does the XMODEM protocol expect that sending data in the raw doesn\u0026rsquo;t that makes testing its functionality difficult?\nInstalling ttywrite utility After finish writing the ttywrite utility, install the tool with cargo install --path . command. This command will be used later to communicate with the bootloader.\n",

        "content": "Setting up the environment Before starting to this series of lab assignments, please make sure that you have followed the environment setup described below.\nOur labs are designed based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. This is done using docker so that everyone has similar setups.\nWe recommend you to stick to this ubuntu version unless you might face some configuration issues.\nYou will also be using use QEMU, an x86 emulator for easier executing and debugging process instead of using real raspberry pi board.\nThis section has the information you’ll need to setup the environment.\nDocker You may install Ubuntu 20.04 on WSL and skip to the next part .\nYou first need to install docker for your OS:\nWindows Mac Linux Spin up Container Please ensure that your installation location for Docker has atleast 10GB of free space.\nGo to your working directory where you\u0026rsquo;ll be working inside and run:\ndocker run -it --name os_labs -v $(pwd):/root/workdir:Z ubuntu:20.04 Now you\u0026rsquo;ll be inside the container, where you\u0026rsquo;ll see a prompt like this:\nroot@e8f10931f506:/# Your working directory will now be available in /root/workdir/.\nFor resuming the container after you\u0026rsquo;ve exited:\ndocker start -i os_labs Anyone with SELINUX enabled distros like Fedora may face some problems with shared dirs between the host and the containers. Please contact the TAs if you get stuck somewhere.\nGetting Repository and Installing Dependencies Please ensure that whatever directory you decide to keep the lab in, it has atleast 10GB of free space.\n# Download the repository git clone https://github.com/pratyush3757/cs330_os.git --origin skeleton rustos cd rustos/ git switch lab3 # Install dependencies ./bin/setup.sh # Update environment source ~/.bashrc You\u0026rsquo;re all set to go back to the lab document if the setup.sh runs correctly and says [!] Setup complete.\nContact a TA if it throws an error.\nReference This section has the information for the various tools you\u0026rsquo;ll be using during the labs.\nWe will be updating this section with more required info as the labs go on.\nMakefile Our Makefile includes a number of targets to test and run our OS in various ways.\nmake Build kernel in release mode. The result executable and binary will be located under build/ subdirectory. make debug Build Rust libraries or kernel in debug mode. make check Check a local package and all of its dependencies for errors. make qemu Start QEMU with the executable file under build/ subdirectory generated by make command. QEMU will generate a detailed log of assembly code of the guest. To exit QEMU, press Ctrl-a x. make objdump Disassemble the executable file generated by make. make nm List all symbols in the executable file generated by make. make clean Clean the directory. make install Install compiled kernel image to SD card. (Not needed until we have physical RPi devices) make test Execute all unit and integration tests and build examples of a local package. QEMU Emulator QEMU (manual ) is a modern and fast PC emulator. We are providing a pre-built QEMU binary to emulate raspberry pi 3+ board as /bin/qemu-system-aarch64.\nQEMU includes a built-in monitor that can inspect and modify the machine state in useful ways. To enter the monitor, press Ctrl-a c in the terminal running QEMU. Press Ctrl-a c again to switch back to the serial console.\nFor a complete reference to the monitor commands, see the QEMU manual . Here are some particularly useful commands:\nxp/Nx paddr Display a hex dump of N words starting at physical address paddr. If N is omitted, it defaults to 1. This is the physical memory analogue of GDB’s x command. info registers Display a full dump of the machine’s internal register state. In particular, this includes the machine’s hidden segment state for the segment selectors and the local, global, and interrupt descriptor tables, plus the task register. This hidden state is the information the virtual CPU read from the GDT/LDT when the segment selector was loaded. info mem Display mapped virtual memory and permissions. For example, ef7c0000-ef800000 00040000 urw efbf8000-efc00000 00008000 -rw tells us that the 0x00040000 bytes of memory from 0xef7c0000 to 0xef800000 are mapped read/write and user-accessible, while the memory from 0xefbf8000 to 0xefc00000 is mapped read/write, but only kernel-accessible.
